yii2-assets
========

You must include bower packages for all assets that you want to use. This is due to prevent loading bower packages for assets that you don't want to use.

### Install

Either run

```
$ php composer.phar require mg-code/yii2-assets "@dev"

or add

```

```

to the ```require``` section of your `composer.json` file.


## Awesome Grid
You must add
```
"bower-asset/awesome-grid": "*"
